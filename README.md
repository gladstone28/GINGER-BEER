**QUESTION:** Can you tell me how to make Ginger Beer from natural Ginger?
**ANSWER:** Sure! Making ginger beer from natural ginger is a fun and rewarding process. Here's a simple recipe you can follow:

**Ingredients:**
- 1 cup of fresh ginger root, peeled and finely grated
- 1 cup of sugar (can be adjusted to taste)
- 1 lemon (juiced)
- 8 cups of water
- 1/4 teaspoon of active dry yeast
**Equipment:**
- Large pot
- Fine mesh strainer or cheesecloth
- Funnel
- Plastic or glass bottles with tight-sealing caps
**Instructions:**
1. **Prepare the Ginger:** Peel and finely grate the ginger root. You can use a food processor or a grater for this.

2. **Make Ginger Syrup:** In a large pot, combine the grated ginger, sugar, and 2 cups of water. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat and let it simmer for about 5 minutes.

3. **Cool the Mixture:** Remove the pot from the heat and let the ginger syrup cool to room temperature.

4. **Strain the Mixture:** Strain the ginger syrup through a fine mesh strainer or cheesecloth into a large bowl or another pot to remove the ginger solids.

5. **Mix the Ingredients:** Add the lemon juice to the ginger syrup. In a separate small bowl, dissolve the yeast in a little bit of warm water (not hot) and let it sit for a few minutes until it becomes frothy.

6. **Combine Everything:** Pour the ginger syrup, yeast mixture, and remaining 6 cups of water into a large pitcher or container. Stir well to combine.

7. **Ferment:** Using a funnel, pour the ginger beer mixture into clean plastic or glass bottles, leaving about an inch of space at the top. Seal the bottles tightly.

8. **Carbonate:** Let the bottles sit at room temperature for about 48 hours to carbonate. Check the bottles periodically by gently squeezing them. When they feel firm, they are ready.

9. **Refrigerate:** Once carbonated, refrigerate the ginger beer to stop the fermentation process. This will also help the flavors meld and develop.

10. **Enjoy:** Serve your homemade ginger beer chilled. Be sure to open the bottles carefully, as the carbonation may cause them to fizz.

**Tips:**
- Adjust Sweetness: You can adjust the amount of sugar to taste. More sugar will result in a sweeter ginger beer.
- Ginger Intensity: If you prefer a stronger ginger flavor, you can increase the amount of ginger root.
- Fermentation Time: The longer you let the bottles ferment at room temperature, the more carbonated the ginger beer will become. However, be cautious as over-fermentation can cause bottles to burst.
Enjoy your homemade ginger beer!
